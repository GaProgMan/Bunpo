Short Description

In the summer of 2007, I decided that one of the best ways for me to get to grips with event-driven, windows form based programming was to create a program that would help me study the grammar surrounding Japanese verbs.

It was never finished during the summer of 2007, but I have uploaded it to GitHub so that I can get around to finishing it in a public place. I feel that there are things that can be learnt from this project (one of my first in Windows Forms), and I feel that (once polished) it could be used to help students of the Japanese language to revise the gammar surrounding different verb groups.
