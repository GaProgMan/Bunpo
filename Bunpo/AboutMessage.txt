   Welcome to seppydude's Japanese Grammar program!
   This program was made to help me study Japanese grammar over the 2007 summer
   vacation from university. At the minute, it only has verbs, but a later version will
   have all sorts of goodies and shiny objects (hopefully).
   
   If you have any problems or suggestions, please feel free to email me:
